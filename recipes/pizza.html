        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes all you want at the end of the day is a simple cheese pizza. 
            This recipe turns simple into sublime with the addition of an exceptional pizza dough, 
            low-moisture mozzarella cheese, and an easy to make tomato sauce that hits all of the right sweet and savory notes to marry all of the flavors in this pie. 
            A simple garnish of fresh herbs, and you've got perfection on a plate.
        </p>
        <p>
            When serving this veggie pizza, I never have leftovers. 
            You can use low-fat or nonfat sour cream for this dish if you'd like.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a jelly roll pan with nonstick cooking spray.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Press crescent roll dough into the prepared jelly roll pan to form a crust. Let stand 5 minutes. Pierce with a fork.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until dough is fully cooked and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Combine sour cream, cream cheese, ranch seasoning mix, dill, and garlic salt in a medium mixing bowl. Spread the cream cheese mixture on top of cooled crust.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Arrange broccoli, radish, onion, bell pepper, carrot, and celery on top of the cream cheese mixture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cover and let chill, 1 to 2 hours. Cut chilled pizza into 16 squares to serve.</p>
